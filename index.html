          <p>New South Wales leads in tourism for both international and domestic travel, contributing nearly half of Australia's tourism industry. The data, normalized against total tourist numbers, shows a growing trend in Western Australia and Victoria until 2020, likely due to COVID restrictions. Notably, South Australia sees more residents departing for travel than it attracts tourists

                    As anticipated, the primary reasons for tourists visiting Australia are for leisure and visiting family and friends, consistent with the country's high migration rate. 
                    However, business and employment-related travel also play a significant role.

                <p>
                  It is evident that the tourism industry was severely impacted by the pandemic after 2020. Both international arrivals and domestic departures experienced annual increases until 2020, followed by a sharp decline. In 2019, Australia saw its peak with over 21 million tourists.
                  The range dot plot highlights that 2021 continues to have the lowest tourism rates across the major states.

          More interestingly, the States of Tasmania and the Northern Territory appear to generally have more tourists than residential departures which is generally untrue for the remaining states
          Excluding the tragic years of COVID (2020 and 2021), all states seem to attract more visitors each year, except for Tasmania, which has experienced a modest increase of 10,000-20,000 tourists annually. It appears to be the least favored destination for both Australians and foreigners (excluding the ACT, of course).

            Money makes the world go round, and Australia is no exception, thanks to the tourism industry. Despite 2021 being the worst year for international arrivals, that year generated more revenue for all Australian states than the year before. Even Queensland surpassed New South Wales in 2021 in terms of revenue generated from tourism. Despite the COVID restrictions in 2021, New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland each generated over a billion dollars in tourism revenue. 
            This may have been a result of domestic residents 'staycationing' in their own hometowns.
